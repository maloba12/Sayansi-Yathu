Project Name: Sayansi Yathu – Virtual Science Lab

Goal: Improve the 3D simulation shapes and experiment experience without breaking the existing project structure.

Current Situation:
– 3D shapes are currently rendered using JavaScript
– Visual quality of shapes is poor
– The project works, and I do NOT want to redesign the system structure

What I want to achieve:
– Move 3D rendering from JavaScript to Python
– Keep the same project organization, UI, and features
– ONLY upgrade the 3D equipment, lab environment, and simulations

Python technologies to use:

Design the Lab Equipment:
– Use CadQuery or Blender to create detailed 3D models of lab items
– Examples: beakers, test tubes, Bunsen burners, microscopes, flasks

Build the Virtual Lab Environment:
– Use Ursina Engine to assemble the room and place the equipment inside it
– Define user movement and interaction inside the lab
– Ensure it runs smoothly in real-time

Simulate Science Experiments:
– Use Python logic and NumPy to compute experiment results
– Link calculation outputs to the 3D scene
– Update graphics in real-time based on results

Important Constraints:
– Do NOT distort or break the existing project folder structure
– Keep frontend and other modules unchanged
– Only replace the 3D engine and simulation layer

What I want as output from the AI model:
– Migration plan from JavaScript 3D to Python 3D
– Guidance for integrating Python 3D rendering with current frontend
– Example code snippets using:
• CadQuery or Blender for models
• Ursina for assembly & interaction
• Python + NumPy for simulation logic
– Steps to connect Python simulation results to visual updates

End Goal:
Upgrade the 3D shapes and experiment realism in Sayansi Yathu using Python (CadQuery/Blender + Ursina + NumPy) without changing the rest of the project system.
